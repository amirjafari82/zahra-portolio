				To save time, I sketched out a series of hand-drawn concepts based on
				the insights we had gathered and the features that were finalized. I
				designed the key pages and shared them with the technical team. After a
				few rounds of back-and-forth discussion, we finalized near-complete
				versions for the UI, and I immediately jumped into the UI design.
